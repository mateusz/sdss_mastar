Approach 1: deploy via MLFlow and test against the other models
Approach 2: try to reduce MSE via eg:
  * feature engineering: polynomial regression on spectrogram (summarising down to 3 vars)
  * feature engineering: first derivative ofthe spectrogram (trying to capture absorption lines)
  * feature engineering: convert to XYZ (summarise down to 3 vars - but won't capture ultraviolet and infrared)
  * principal component regression (reduce dimensinality)
